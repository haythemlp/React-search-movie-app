# **React Movie Search App**

This is a React app that allows users to search for movies using the OMDBAPI and display the search results on the page.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run **npm install** to install the dependencies.
3. Run **npm start** to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000** to view the app.

**Usage**

To use the app, simply type in a movie title in the search box. The app will fetch the search results from the OMDBAPI and display them on the page.

Clicking on a movie card will take you to a detail page for that movie, which displays more information about the movie.
